|----------|--------------|--------|------------|
|Clinical questionnaire |Perceived stress|Perceived stress scale 10-item (PSS-10)|The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is a classic stress assessment instrument. The tool, while originally developed in 1983, remains a popular choice for helping us understand how different situations affect our feelings and our perceived stress. The questions in this scale ask about feelings and thoughts during the last month.|
||Depression|Patient health questionnaire 9-item (PHQ-9)|The PHQ-9 incorporates DSM-IV depression diagnostic criteria with other leading major depressive symptoms into a brief self report tool. The tool rates the frequency of the symptoms which factors into the scoring severity index. |
||Anxiety|Generalized anxiety disorder 7-item (GAD-7)|Self-administered 7 item instrument that uses some of the DSM-V criteria for GAD (General Anxiety Disorder) to identify probable cases of GAD along with measuring anxiety symptom severity.  It can also be used as a screening measure of panic, social anxiety, and PTSD.  When considering a diagnosis, the clinician will still need to use clinical interviewing skills to determine whether the symptoms are causing clinically significant distress or impairment and those symptoms are not better explained or attributed to other conditions (i.e. substance use, medical conditions, bereavement, etc.)|
||Resilience|Connor-davidson resilience scale 25-item (CD-RISC-25)|The CD-RISC is a 25-item self-report measure of resilience. The CD-RISC was developed to provide a valid and reliable measure of resilience, establish references values for being resilient or nonresilient in the general population and the psychiatric clinical population, and to assess pharmacological treatment of the psychiatric population and its ability to modify resilience (Connor & Davidson, 2003). Connor and Davidson (2003) conducted an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) of the CD-RISC in the general population sample (n = 577) and identified five factors representing “personal competence, high standards, and tenacity”; “trust in one’s instincts, tolerance of negative affect, and strengthening effects of stress”; “positive acceptance of change and secure relationships”; “control”; and “spirituality.” |
